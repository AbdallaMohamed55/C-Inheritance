# C++-Inheritance

To study and implement Inheritance

# Aim 

To study and implement different types of inheritance in C++ (Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid).

# Theory  

Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (derived/child) acquires the properties and behaviors of another class (base/parent). It improves code reusability and represents real-world relationships.

Types:

* Single Inheritance: One child inherits from one parent.

* Multiple Inheritance: One child inherits from multiple parents.

* Multilevel Inheritance: A child inherits from another child class.

* Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple children inherit from one parent.

* Hybrid Inheritance: Combination of two or more types.

# Procedure

1/ Define base and derived classes using class keyword.

2/ Use : followed by access specifier (public, protected, private) to inherit.

3/ Implement different inheritance modes.

4/ Compile and run the program for each type.

5/ Observe outputs and verify reusability.

# Conclusion 

We successfully implemented and verified all types of inheritance in C++. This demonstrates reusability, modularity, and relationship representation in Object-Oriented Programming.
